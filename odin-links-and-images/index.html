    <h1>Homepage</h1>

<!-- LINKS -->

    <!-- Hyperling needs Anchor and href destination (address). Without href it just act as plain text. -->
        <p><a>About The Odin Project</a></p>

    <!-- This will open the link within the same tab/window -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>

    <!-- While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened.
    If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. 
    To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank as follows:-->
        <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a></p>
    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
    The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.-->
 
        <p><a href="about.html">About</a></p>
    <!-- This works because the about page is in the same directory so we can use it's name as the href value -->

    <!-- If we move the about page in a different directory, (pages) we need to adjust our href as shown bellow -->
        <p><a href="pages/about.html">About</a></p>

    <!-- In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. 
    Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. 
    By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative 
    to the current directory. -->
        <p><a href="./pages/about.html">About</a></p>

<!-- IMAGES -->

    <!-- SRC Attribute 
        To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered, 
        the <img> element is self-closing. Empty, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.
        Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute 
        which tells the browser where the image file is located. The src attribute works much like the href attribute 
        for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.-->
        <!--For example, using an absolute path we can display an image located on The Odin Project site:-->
            <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
    
        <!-- Start looking straight from directory ./ -->
        <img src="./images/dog.jpg">

    <!-- Adding ALT attribute
        Besides the src attribute, every image element must also have an alt (alternative text) attribute.
        The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
        It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
        This is how the The Odin Project logo example we used earlier looks with an alt attribute included: -->
             <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">

        <!--Image size attributes 
        While not strictly required, specifying height and width attributes in image tags helps the browser 
        layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.
        It is a good habit to always specify these attributes on every image, even when 
        the image is the correct size or you are using CSS to modify it -->
            <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">
